**Problem Statement:** Maintaining a churn rate below 10% is one of the primary concerns of any streaming platform.

**Solution:** Recommendation Systems with optimal algorithms can play a dominant role.

**Impact:** Model predicted with the precision of ~75% and may retain users with apt movies.

**Techniques:** Rank based, Similarity-based Collaborative filtering, Matrix factorization (SVD) based Collaborative filtering

**Run the code in Google Colab by mounting google drive with ratings.csv file in the drive. 
It is suggested to run the colab rather than Jupyter notebook because Surprise library is not much compatible with it.**
